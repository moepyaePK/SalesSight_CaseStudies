2. Sprint 1 Retrospective

### What Went Well
Sprint 1 marked a strong start for our team, with several notable achievements. The integration of AI tools into our UI development workflow proved to be a major advantage, enabling us to quickly generate design prototypes and streamline the implementation of user interfaces. This not only saved time but also allowed us to experiment with different design options and select the most effective solutions. Daily chat check-ins were instrumental in maintaining open lines of communication, ensuring that everyone was aware of ongoing tasks, blockers, and priorities. The team demonstrated a high level of commitment and adaptability, responding promptly to feedback and collaborating effectively to resolve issues. Our initial project planning and setup provided a solid foundation, helping us organize our codebase and clarify roles and responsibilities early in the sprint.

### What Didn't Go Well
Despite our successes, Sprint 1 presented several challenges that impacted our workflow and productivity. One of the most significant issues was the occurrence of merge conflicts, which resulted from team members working independently on shared files without regular synchronization. These conflicts required considerable time and effort to resolve, occasionally leading to lost work and frustration. Our use of Google Docs for task management was less effective than anticipated; many tasks lacked clear descriptions and acceptance criteria, making it difficult to track progress and assign ownership. Additionally, some requirements changed during the sprint, causing confusion and necessitating rework. This highlighted the need for more thorough requirement gathering and validation before sprint kickoff. Another technical challenge was the CSV file upload feature: when users uploaded a CSV file, the contents were not displayed for review, making it difficult to verify data accuracy and completeness before processing.

### What Could We Improve
To build on our strengths and address the challenges identified, we propose several improvements for future sprints. First, we should break down user stories into smaller, well-defined technical sub-tasks with clear acceptance criteria, making it easier to assign tasks and monitor progress. Regularly pulling the latest changes from the main branch before starting new feature work will help prevent merge conflicts and ensure everyone is working with the most up-to-date codebase. Implementing formal Pull Requests with mandatory code reviews will enhance code quality and facilitate knowledge sharing among team members. We also recommend refining our task management process by providing detailed descriptions and clear ownership for each task in Google Docs. Before each sprint, requirements should be thoroughly discussed and validated to minimize mid-sprint changes and rework. Finally, improving the CSV upload feature to allow users to review the contents of uploaded files before final submission will increase data reliability and user confidence in the system.

3. Lessons Learned
Sprint 1 reinforced the importance of clear communication, collaborative problem-solving, and proactive planning. By reflecting on our experiences and implementing targeted improvements, we aim to create a more efficient and enjoyable development process in future sprints. The insights gained from this retrospective will guide our approach to teamwork, technical decision-making, and project management as we continue to develop SalesSight.
