# Test Plan

## Document Control
- Version: 0.1
- Author: 
- Date: 
- Status: Draft

## 1. Overview
- Purpose: Summarize objectives and scope of testing for the release/feature.
- System/Project: 
- References: requirement specs, design docs, user stories, acceptance criteria.

## 2. Objectives
- Verify functional correctness against requirements.
- Ensure stability, performance, and security as applicable.
- Reduce risk for production release.

## 3. Scope
- In-scope: list modules/features to be tested.
- Out-of-scope: list excluded items and reasons.

## 4. Test Items
- Features to be tested (bulleted list).
- Features not to be tested (bulleted list).

## 5. Test Strategy & Approach
- Types of testing: unit, integration, API, UI, end-to-end, regression, performance, security, compatibility, accessibility.
- Test techniques: manual, automated, exploratory, data-driven.
- Test prioritization: smoke -> critical -> regression -> exploratory.

## 6. Test Environment
- Environments: dev, QA, staging, performance, production (canary).
- Hardware, OS, browsers, devices, network conditions.
- Test data: generation, masking, refresh cadence.

## 7. Test Deliverables
- Test plan, test cases, test scripts, test results, defect reports, coverage matrix, final test summary.

## 8. Schedule
- Milestones: test design complete, test execution start, regression, performance window, test complete, release readiness.
- Estimated effort / resources.

## 9. Roles & Responsibilities
- Test Lead:
- QA Engineers:
- Developers:
- Product Owner/Business:
- DevOps:

## 10. Entry & Exit Criteria
- Entry: environment ready, test data available, build accepted, critical defects fixed.
- Exit: all critical/high defects fixed or mitigated, test coverage targets met, acceptance sign-off.

## 11. Risk & Mitigation
- Known risks, impact, probability, mitigation actions.

## 12. Defect Management
- Tool: (e.g., Jira)
- Severity/Priority definitions and workflow.

## 13. Traceability
- Requirement -> Test Case mapping strategy and location (matrix/link).
