This repository appears to contain a **Streamlit web application designed for data analysis and sales forecasting, complete with user management capabilities.**

Here's a breakdown of what the files suggest:

*   **Streamlit Application:** The presence of `.streamlit/config.toml`, `Home.py`, and the `pages/` directory (containing `dashboard.py`, `data_upload.py`, `sales_forecasting.py`, etc.) strongly indicates a multi-page Streamlit application. Streamlit is a popular Python library for building interactive data science web apps.
*   **User Management:** `auth.py`, `db.py`, `pages/login.py`, `pages/register.py`, and `users.db` point to a system with user registration, login, authentication, and user data storage (likely in an SQLite database, given `users.db`).
*   **Core Functionality - Data Upload & Sales Forecasting:**
    *   `pages/data_upload.py`: Suggests users can upload their data into the application.
    *   `pages/sales_forecasting.py`: This is a key feature, indicating the application performs sales forecasting based on the uploaded data.
    *   `pages/dashboard.py`: Likely where the results of the forecasting and other data insights are visualized and presented.
*   **Utilities & Configuration:** `utils.py` contains common helper functions, `requirements.txt` lists Python dependencies, and `pages/setting.py` might handle user or application settings.
*   **Development & Project Management:** `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for consistent development environments, `retrospectives/sprint-1-retro.md`, and `testing/sprint-2-test-plan.md` indicate structured project development.

In essence, it's a **Streamlit-powered platform where users can log in, upload datasets, perform sales forecasting, and view the results on an interactive dashboard.**

Regarding your feature request: **"can you add a feature where we ask for the feedback from the user after file analysis is done?"**

Yes, this is a very sensible feature to add to this application. Given the current structure, here's how you could implement it:

1.  **Identify "File Analysis Done":**
    *   The "file analysis" likely culminates in the `pages/sales_forecasting.py` page where the forecasting results are displayed, or potentially on the `pages/dashboard.py` if that's where the final processed insights are presented. The most logical place would be *after* the forecast has been generated and displayed to the user.

2.  **Modify the Frontend (Streamlit Page):**
    *   You would add Streamlit widgets to the relevant page (e.g., `pages/sales_forecasting.py` or `pages/dashboard.py`).
    *   **Example Widgets:**
        *   `st.subheader("We'd love your feedback!")`
        *   `st.text_area("How accurate or helpful were the predictions?", key="feedback_text")`
        *   `st.radio("Overall satisfaction:", ["Very Dissatisfied", "Dissatisfied", "Neutral", "Satisfied", "Very Satisfied"], index=2, key="feedback_rating")`
        *   `st.button("Submit Feedback", key="submit_feedback_btn")`

3.  **Update the Database (`db.py` and `users.db`):**
    *   You'll need a new table in your `users.db` SQLite database to store this feedback.
    *   **Example Table Schema (`feedback`):**
        *   `id` (PRIMARY KEY, INTEGER)
        *   `user_id` (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to `users` table)
        *   `analysis_id` (INTEGER, if you want to link feedback to a specific forecast run)
        *   `feedback_text` (TEXT)
        *   `rating` (TEXT or INTEGER, depending on your chosen scale)
        *   `timestamp` (DATETIME)
    *   **Modify `db.py`:** Add functions to:
        *   Create this `feedback` table if it doesn't exist (e.g., in a `_init_db()` function).
        *   Insert new feedback records (`add_feedback(user_id, analysis_id, feedback_text, rating)`).

4.  **Integrate Backend Logic with Frontend:**
    *   In your Streamlit page (`pages/sales_forecasting.py`):
        *   When the `Submit Feedback` button is clicked (`st.session_state.submit_feedback_btn` is True):
            *   Retrieve the `user_id` (from the authenticated user, likely stored in `st.session_state`).
            *   Retrieve the feedback text (`st.session_state.feedback_text`) and rating (`st.session_state.feedback_rating`).
            *   Call the `db.py` function `add_feedback()` to store the data.
            *   Display a "Thank you for your feedback!" message.

**Example Pseudo-code for `pages/sales_forecasting.py`:**

```python
import streamlit as st
import db # Assuming db.py contains your database interaction functions
import auth # Assuming auth.py handles user sessions

st.title("Sales Forecasting Results")

# ... (code to perform forecasting and display results) ...

if st.button("Generate Forecast", key="generate_forecast_btn"):
    st.write("Forecast generated successfully!")
    # Display forecast charts, tables, etc.
    # st.line_chart(forecast_data)

    st.subheader("We'd love your feedback!")
    feedback_text = st.text_area("How accurate or helpful were the predictions?", key="feedback_text_area")
    feedback_rating = st.radio("Overall satisfaction:",
                                ["Very Dissatisfied", "Dissatisfied", "Neutral", "Satisfied", "Very Satisfied"],
                                index=2, key="feedback_rating_radio")

    if st.button("Submit Feedback", key="submit_feedback_btn"):
        if feedback_text or feedback_rating: # Ensure some feedback is provided
            user_id = auth.get_current_user_id() # Assuming you have a way to get the logged-in user's ID
            if user_id:
                # You might also want to store an 'analysis_id' if you track individual forecast runs
                db.add_feedback(user_id, None, feedback_text, feedback_rating) # `None` for analysis_id for now
                st.success("Thank you for your valuable feedback!")
            else:
                st.error("You must be logged in to submit feedback.")
        else:
            st.warning("Please provide some feedback before submitting.")

```

This approach leverages the existing database and authentication system, making the integration relatively straightforward.
