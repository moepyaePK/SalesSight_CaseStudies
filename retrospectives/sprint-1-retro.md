2. Sprint 1 Retrospective

## 1. What Went Well
* AI integration in UI development significantly improved efficiency, allowing rapid generation of design prototypes.
* Enabled faster experimentation with multiple design options to find the most effective solutions.
* Daily chat check-ins maintained strong communication, keeping everyone informed about tasks, blockers, and priorities.
* The team showed high commitment and adaptability, quickly responding to feedback and resolving issues collaboratively.
* Initial project planning and setup provided a solid foundation, ensuring organized code structure and clear role allocation early in the sprint.

## 2. What Didn't Go Well
* Merge conflicts occurred frequently due to independent work on shared files without proper synchronization.
* Resolving conflicts consumed significant time and effort, occasionally leading to lost work and frustration.
* Using Google Docs for task management proved ineffective — tasks lacked clear descriptions and acceptance criteria.
* Unclear task ownership made it difficult to track progress and accountability.
* Changing requirements during the sprint caused confusion and rework.
* The CSV file upload feature lacked a data preview, preventing users from verifying file contents before processing.

## 3. What Could We Improve
* Break down user stories into smaller, well-defined technical sub-tasks with clear acceptance criteria.
* Regularly pull updates from the main branch to minimize merge conflicts and ensure alignment.
* Implement formal Pull Requests with mandatory code reviews to improve code quality and share knowledge.
* Enhance task management by adding detailed descriptions, clear ownership, and updated tracking.
* Validate and finalize requirements before sprint kickoff to reduce mid-sprint changes and rework.
* Improve the CSV upload feature to include a preview option, allowing users to verify data before submission.

## 4. Lessons Learned
* Clear communication, collaboration, and proactive planning are essential for effective teamwork.
* Reflecting on Sprint 1 has highlighted both our strengths and growth areas.
* The lessons learned will guide future improvements in technical decisions, team processes, and project management to make development more efficient and enjoyable.
